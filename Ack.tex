\def\baselinestretch{1.0}
\setlinespacing{1.0} I am grateful to my parents and family for their
patience and {\em love}. Without them this work would never have come into
existence (literally).

My graduate studies in the US were supported in part by the National
Petroleum Research Council.

\medskip
Finally, I wish to thank the following: \,  Dr. Mari Mori; {\em and } my
brother (because he asked me to).   I'd also like to recognise an individual
who has served as a source of inspiration, encouragement, and generosity in
my life; my dear uncle Ira Lieberman.
